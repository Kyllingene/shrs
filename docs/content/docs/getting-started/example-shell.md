[shrs_example](https://github.com/MrPicklePinosaur/shrs/tree/master/shrs_example)
is an example shell that makes use of the default features provided by
**shrs**. If you want a working shell quickly, you can simply install the
binary directly. However, the goal of **shrs** is to provide a fully
customizable shell that you can build yourself in rust, it is recommended that
you make your own project, which you can learn about in the Quick Start section.
