Welcome to **shrs**, the toolkit that will help you build and configure your
own shell in **Rust**!

First of all **shrs** is NOT a shell, it is a library for YOU to build your own
shell. It is meant for those that have reached the limits of what can be
accomplished with just tinkering with the configuration files of pre-existing
shells and would like to go beyond and add experimental and wild features to
their own shells.

### Quick Start
